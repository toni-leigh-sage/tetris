## Background

I wrote this originally as personal project - challenge: to build a working Tetris game, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in one weekend.

Now I have revived this and am adding new features including local storage high-scoring, an option to use prime pieces (3 or 5 squares), change board size and some graphic enhancement that shows the keys. And some tests, now I've grown up a bit, but for challenge just using JavaScript.

I'm also taking the chance to flex another skill: how to effectively work in a code-base that differs distinctly from how I code now. This code-base uses an older style of coding from my current one, but consistency in the code-base is very important, so my ideas of how code should look and be written shouldn't apply immediately when coming into a new team, I need to first understand the reasoning then make my case if it's still valid. OK, this case is not an exact analogue, but it's given me an opportunity to act in the way I think is best as a new team member.

Deployed with GitHub and CloudFlare, 38kb total in 30s, makes one wonder whether we do things better now?

## To play
