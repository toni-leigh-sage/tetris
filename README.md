## Background

I wrote this originally as personal project - challenge: to build in a working Tetris game, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in one weekend.

Now I have revived this and am adding new features including local storage high-scoring, an option to use prime pieces (3 or 5 squares), change board size and some graphic enhancement that shows the keys. And some tests, now I've grown up a bit, but for challenge just using JavaScript.

Deployed with GitHub and CloudFlare, 38kb total in 30s, makes one wonder whether we do things better now?

## To play

Left arrow: piece one square left
Right arrow: piece one square right
Down arrow: move piece down fast
Up arrow: lol, nope

Space bar: rotate piece 90deg.
