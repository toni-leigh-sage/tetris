## Background

I wrote this originally as personal project - challenge: to build a working Tetris game, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in one weekend.

Now I have revived this and am adding new features including local storage high-scoring, an option to use prime pieces (3 or 5 squares), change board size and some graphic enhancement that shows the keys. And some tests, now I've grown up a bit, but for challenge just using JavaScript.

I'm also taking the chance to flex another skill: how to effectively work in a code-base that differs distinctly from how I code now. **Consistency in a code-base is very important**, so my ideas of how to code, while potentially valid, shouldn't apply immediately when coming into a new team as I need to first understand the reasoning behind and the holistic position of the new code. While this is me coding with me - 10 years, **the opportunity still exists here to flex that skill**.

Another thing I'm doing is **learning more about the in-browser APIs** and JavaScript functions with a view to keeping things written a way that everything supports, expanding my knowledge of what was done when in the client-side environments, which in turn leads to **improved global accessibility**.

Deployed with GitHub and CloudFlare, 38kb total in 30s, makes one wonder whether we do things better now?

## To play

Left arrow: piece one square left
Right arrow: piece one square right
Down arrow: move piece down fast
Up arrow: lol, nope
